Passdora
========

Passdora is a Raspberry Pi based system which hosts the [Sequry password-manager](https://dev.quiqqer.com/sequry/core).  
The [Sequry password-manager](https://dev.quiqqer.com/sequry/core) makes storing and sharing passwords easy with the main focus on security.  
Using modern symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms the systems ensures that passwords can only be seen by persons that have the permission to do so.
  
Since Passdora is a small box it can be easily placed in every companies' office or in a normal persons home environment. All it needs is a connection to mains power and the local network.  
By being hosted locally and not in the cloud, the user always knows where his valuable data is stored and administrated. This also protects the system from external hacking attempts.  
  
The target audience are small to medium-sized companies that look for a way to store passwords and share them with their employees without the need to entrust valuable data to a cloud provider.
